# Ravenous

Welcome to Ravenous, a restaurant recommendation website that helps users discover local businesses based on their location and search keywords. This project replicates the core functionality of Yelp, giving users an intuitive and dynamic experience to find their next favorite eatery.

Purpose
The goal of Ravenous is to build a fully functional web application using technologies like React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while integrating with the Yelp API to fetch real restaurant data. This project is part of my React learning and an opportunity to further develop skills in building interactive UIs, managing data flows, and connecting to external APIs.

Planned Features:
- Homepage Design: A sleek, static interface featuring a header, a search bar, and a list of mock business data.
- User Interaction: Users can simulate a restaurant search by typing in the search bar.
- Navigation: A user-friendly scrolling experience to explore content.
- Dynamic Search Results: Fetch and display real restaurant data using the Yelp API.
- Sorting & Filtering Options: Allow users to sort results by ratings, price, or category.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the website looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

Technologies Used
- React: For building the application and its dynamic user interface.
- JavaScript: To implement application logic and interactive features.
- HTML & CSS: To structure and style the application.
- Yelp API: For fetching real-time restaurant data.
